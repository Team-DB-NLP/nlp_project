        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 
        * 

* Explore dataset for predictors of property value ('__')
    * Answer the following questions:
    * 
    * 
    * 
    * 

* Develop a model
    * Using the selected data features develop appropriate predictive models
    * Evaluate the models in action using train and validate splits as well as scaled data
    * Choose the most accurate model 
    * Evaluate the most accurate model using the final test data set
    * Draw conclusions
